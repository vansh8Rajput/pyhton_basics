What is Python, and why is it popular?\n"," Ans.python is a high-level,interpreated(code is executed line by line)programming language.\n"," puthon is developed by guide vah rose in 1991.\n","\n"," Reason for its popularity.\n"," 1.widely used in industry.\n"," 2.data industry(data science)\n"," 3.easy to learn.\n"," 4.automation\n"," 5.image processing.\n"," 6.use in AI and ML.\n"," 7.lot of libraries(some build define function)\n","\n"," Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n"," Ans. An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line.\n"," ex:python.\n"," not like compiling the complete program at once like a compiler does.\n"," ex:java ,c++\n","\n","Q.3 What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","Ans.keywords are reserved word in python with a specific meaning and keywords can not be used as identifiers.\n","ex:continue,break etc.\n","\n","Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","Ans.No, keywords can not be used as variable name.\n","it is strictly mension in the rules of variable that keywords can not be used as the name of the variable.\n","ex:continue,break etc.\n","\n","Q5. What is mutability in Python?\n","Ans.mutability means value Can be changed.\n","You can modify, add, or delete their contents without changing their identity (memory address stays the same).\n","ex:list,dic,set\n","\n","Q6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","Ans.List is mutable because we can change its value after creating it.\n","We can add, remove, or update items in list.\n","Python allow this because list is used when data can change.\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_list[0] = 9  # list changed\n","\n","Tuple is immutable because we cannot change its value.\n","Once tuple is made, we cannot add or remove anything.\n","Python made tuple for fixed data, like settings or fixed values.\n","\n","my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","my_tuple[0] = 9  #this give error\n","\n","Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","Ans.\"==\" check value is same or not.\n","It see if two things have same data inside.\n","\n","a = [1, 2, 3]\n","b = [1, 2, 3]\n","print(a == b)  # True\n","\n","a = [1, 2, 3]\n","b = [1, 2, 3]\n","print(a is b)  #False,because both are different objects\n","But if both point to same thing:\n","\n","a = [1, 2, 3]\n","b = a\n","print(a is b)  # True, because both are same object now.\n","\n","Q8.What are logical operators in Python?\n","Ans.Logical operators are used to check multiple conditions together.\n","They give result in True or False.\n","\n","Python has 3 main logical operators:\n","1. and\n","Both conditions must be True.\n","\n","a = 10\n","print(a > 5 and a < 20)  # True\n","2. or\n","Any one condition must be True.\n","\n","a = 10\n","print(a < 5 or a < 20)  # True\n","3. not\n","It gives opposite of the condition.\n","\n","a = 10\n","print(not a > 5)  # False\n","\n","Q9. What is type casting in Python?\n","Ans . If we want to convert one data type into another datatype,if datatype can be fit into another data type.\n","ex:\n","a=2.4\n","a=int(a)\n","print(a)#2\n","print(type(a))#int\n","\n","Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","Ans.the process of changeing one datatype into another of a value or variable.\n","two types\n","1.implicit\n","2.explicit\n","\n","Implicit>auto find type of data.\n","ex:a=12#int\n","b=\"vansh\"#str\n","\n","Explicit>we change data type by writing code.\n","ex:a=2.4\n","a=int(a)\n","print(a)#2\n","print(type(a))#int\n","\n","Q11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","Ans.conditional statements are used to make decisions in code.\n","They help Python know what to do based on condition (True or False).\n","If condition is True, one part runs. If False, another part runs.\n","types\n","1.if.\n","ex:\n","a=10\n","if a%2==0:\n","    print(\"even\")\n","2.else.\n","\n","ex:\n","b=13\n","if b%2==0:\n","    print(\"even\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"odd\")\n","3.elif.\n","\n","ex:\n","c=100\n","if c<100:\n","    print(\"smaller\")\n","elif c>100:\n","    print(\"greater\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"equal\")\n","\n","Q.12How does the elif statement work?\n","Ans.elif means \"else if\".\n","It is used when we want to check many conditions, not just one.\n","How it works:\n",".Python check the first if condition.\n",".If if is False, it check elif.\n",".If elif is True, it run that block and skip the rest.\n","\n","We can write many elif after if.\n","\n","Example:\n","marks = 75\n","\n","if marks >= 90:\n","    print(\"Grade A\")\n","elif marks >= 70:\n","    print(\"Grade B\")\n","elif marks >= 50:\n","    print(\"Grade C\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Fail\")\n","o>Grade B\n","Why use elif?\n",".To avoid writing many if and else\n",".Makes code clean and easy to read\n","\n","Q.13 What is the difference between for and while loop?\n","Ans.loops statement is a fundamental part of programming language that allows to repeteadly to execute a code based on conditions.\n","types\n","1.for\n","2.while\n","\n","1.While loop:it is executed repeteadly a block of code as long as condition is true\n","ex:\n","n=7\n","i=1\n","while(n>i):\n","    print(i)\n","    i+=1\n","else:\n","    print(\"these will execute after completion of while loop\")\n","2.for loop:used to iterate over a sequence of elements #ex:string and list\n","ex:\n","for i in range(0,20):\n","    if i%2!=0:\n","        continue\n","    print(i)\n","\n","Q14.
